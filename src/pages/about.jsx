          <h1>Bale Bale becomes Bale Bale Rumba</h1>
          <p>Bale Bale Bistro food truck was the initial business in January 2021 promoting Baleadas and Pupusas, original dishes from beautiful Honduras. In July 2023, Bale Bale acquired Rumba's Restaurant, which already operated a variety of Latin dishes, and this is when Honduras joins Cuba, Puerto Rico, Colombia and Mexico to merge flavors and become Bale Bale Rumba Latin Cuisine. We are so excited to become the first Restaurant in Colorado Springs with influence from 5 Latin American countries</p>
