<h1>What customers are saying</h1>
<p id="review-text">L Edwards: Came here with some friends after an afternoon of playing games. I have a little dog that goes everywhere with me because she has a heart problem. They were very understanding and even made a plate of chicken for her because she can't eat any other meat.

I ordered empanadas and got three different flavors. The chicken, pizza, and cheese. I asked the waitress for some sort of sauce and she recommended the creamy cilantro. I really enjoyed the pizza empanada especially with the creamy cilantro sauce. I enjoyed the pizza empanada, the chicken not so much.

Everyone was impressed with the amount of food they got and they enjoyed their meals.

Our waitress was very friendly, helpful, and attentive.</p>
<p id="review-text">Josh Homer: First time visit to Rumba. It was my birthday, and wanted something different and delicious. So glad we stopped in!
Love the atmosphere! Gives a tiki bar vibe. There is outdoor seating available.
I wanted a birthday drink, so I got the lemon drop martini. Really good! Hit the spot. My wife had the Rumba. Not sure what's in it, but it was killer. She said it was the best cocktail she's ever had. They also make a PERFECT Cuba Libre.
The food is the star here. We started with the Alcapurria. Crispy and delicious on the outside, with creamy goodness on the inside.
I decided on the Ropa Vieja. Great choice! The shredded beef had an amazing sauce. Not spicy at all. The mashed yuca and red beans were delicious, and went perfectly with the beef.
My wife had the Beef Flautas. Easily the best. The Tostones are crispy and flavorful. I honestly want a giant order of those lol.
The flan was the BEST I've ever had. Seemed like a cross between traditional custard flan, and bread pudding.
Our server was awesome. He was so nice and attentive! He really wanted me to have a nice birthday dinner. I had an amazing birthday dinner. We will definitely be back soon.</p>
<p id="review-text">Precilla Stringer: I am speechless! What an experience! Great ambiance and top-notch service and food!! Local family owned restaurant... my favorite kinds of places to eat!

First off, the place is very well decorated and clean! There's adequate space between tables, and there's also a bar to sit at, which was also very clean and well lit.

The owners Noe and Tirza, which I had never met until tonight, made me feel so welcomed and provided top-notch service. I left there feeling like I've known them for forever! ❤️

I chose to eat the Churrasco with a side of rice and beans and some tostones (fried plantains). The food was amazing! I also had a side of Chile de Arbol Mexican salsa... it was the perfect balance of heat and flavor!

Another note about the food, this restaurant serves authentic Latin cuisine! You can get it all under one roof! It's not just Mexican flavors, but Cuban and other countries as well! You have to try it!!

Notice in one of my pictures,  our lovely bartender is using the freshest mint to make the cocktails! And with a smile!

Parking: There is plenty of flat parking.

Ambiance: Latin music playing added a nice vibe to my experience.

I just left, and I'm hungry for more! Until next time, Rumba! I can't wait to try something else delicious! You just gained a loyal customer tonight (me)!!</p>
